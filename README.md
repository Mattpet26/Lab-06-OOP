# Lab06

**Author**: Ameilia Valdes, Matthew Petersen
**Version**: 1.0.0 

## Overview
OOP principles. We created multiple classes to inherit methods+properties, then tested that the inheritence worked properly.

## Getting Started
Clone the repository down to your local machine with: Git clone clonedRepoHere
Enter VSC and view all of our beautiful tests!
(tomorrow I presume we will be making this work in the console)

## Example

## Architecture
C# + VSC with some inheritance!

## Change Log
01/18/2021 - initial upload of the lab! Stay tuned for more.

1/19/2021 - New repository created, prior repo had incorrect file structure which broke after cloning. Unsure why this break happened, but it seems to be resolved.
